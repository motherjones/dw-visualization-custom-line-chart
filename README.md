# Datawrapper line chart

Theoretically, I should build off the original line chart instead of copying the code.
This is more of an exersize in understanding the plugin structure without accidentally
mangling upstream code :)

## Install

**CAVEAT**: you can only have one line chart installed at a time. 

```
cd /path/to/datawrapper
git clone <this_repo> plugins/visualization-custom-line-chart
php scripts/plugin.php install visualization-custom-line-chart
```
